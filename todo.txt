Need to organize the sim module:
	
Nearly done - now just implement resetting the simulation using the
SimController. Question is where do we store the inital states - in the
SimWires themselves? Seems like the best option - the only other option is to
store an InitState separately, for each wire, in the SimController. The only
advantage to this method is that it makes SimWire more lightweight, and
there's really just not much point to that.
